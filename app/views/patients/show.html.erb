PROJECT INFO 
With Nested Routes your Controller needs to respond differently depending on whether the request that matched that route that led you to that controler action was a nested route or not. If it was a nested route it should give you a different list of things than if it was a non nested route.  
/appointments => You should get all of the appointments back
/patients/1/appointments => Should only show appointments for that particular patient 

patient_appointments GET    
/patients/:patient_id/appointments(.:format)
