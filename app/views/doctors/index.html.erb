<h1>Doctors</h1>
<button><%= link_to "Add Doctor", new_doctor_path %></button>

  <p><%= link_to  doctor.name, doctor_path(doctor) %></p>
<% end %>
<%# 
doctor name with link to the show page 
to_params is called on the argument passed into doctor_path  

How do we determine what to put in the argument? 
If you look at the routes, and find the doctor_path /doctors/:id 
The :id means you need to put a doctor id in.  Don't include .id in the parameter. 

The reason we sometimes see it as @doctor and not doctor is because sometimes it's an instance variable and not a local variable, or a block parameter.
